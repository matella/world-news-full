# Implementation record

Roadmap: https://github.com/matella/world-news-full/issues/1

| Batch | Issues | Observable completion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Foundation | #2, #3, #4, #9 | Baseline/fixtures, pinned GADS audit, ADR and editorial policy |
| Existing app safety | #5, #6, #7, #8 | Durable disposable DB, protected admin, honest errors, reproducible checks |
| Rust baseline | #10–#17 | Runnable web/config, owned schema, import, auth and revision primitives |
| Independent publishing | #18–#33 | Intake/jobs/editor/editions independent of Jarvis, citations/length rules |
| Reader migration | #34–#43 | Required routes and archives with accessible Rust templates |
| Release evidence | #44–#49 | Performance/health/recovery/integration evidence and cutover preparation |

Work on scoped branches/PRs. Completion of a branch is not merge, deployment or
issue closure; link exact evidence and keep remaining gates visible. P0 fixes
can advance once foundational rules are available. Follow issue dependencies;
if a prerequisite is only staged in a preceding branch, stack the PR explicitly.
Never mark 48 issues complete because a scaffold exists. Optional AI remains off.

Current production schema, exposure, storage and publisher are unverified. Local
source implementation and disposable tests continue without production access.
